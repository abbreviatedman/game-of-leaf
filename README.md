TODO:
* The ability to set the size of the board. I have that in a variable, so should be able to extend that.
* The ability to hit play and have it auto-step. Just step with a timeout, so this should also be fairly easy.
* Some SERIOUS refactoring, as I'm still approaching the Elm nail with a JavaScript hammer.
