# gameofleaf

Game of Leaf is a Game of Life in Elm. (Get it? Do you get it? DO YOU.)

Right now it starts out with a hard-coded board of a hard-coded size, and you can Step through it. But! It does wrap around,
which is rare in implementations.

To launch: just npm install and npm start.

TODO:
1. The ability to actually toggle squares. Should be an easy fix in that small-but-broken function.
2. The ability to hit play and have it auto-step. Just step with a timeout, so should be pretty easy.
3. The ability to set the size of the board. I'm pretty set up to extend that.
4. Some SERIOUS refactoring, as I'm still approaching the Elm nail with a JavaScript hammer.
5. Probably more features eventually.
